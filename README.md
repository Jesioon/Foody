# Foody v1.0

This is my second project in Django, but first that I wrote myself. 

Foody is Web application where people can store their own recipes and share them with others. Anyone can browse all recipes, that are store in this application, but
if you want to add your own recipe, you must create an account. To do this you need to type in your login, email and password twice. When you are logged in, you can browse yours
recipes, that you added and naturally add another one.

To add new recipe you have to type recipe name, ingredients and recipe process step by step. If you fill only that three inputs, others will set on default values (image too).
Only if you are recipe owner you can edit and delete it (or if you are admin :)). 

If you are looking for particular recipe, you can try to search it by name.

Button in the center of the home page changes depends on hour and redirect to appropriate page.

Application is full responsive, layout changes depends on screen resolution.
